Netflix Data Cleaning Project

This project is part of the Data Analyst Internship. The objective was to clean and preprocess a raw Netflix dataset using Python libraries like Pandas. The cleaned data can now be used for further analysis or visualization.

Steps Performed:

Handled missing values in columns like country, rating, cast, and director

Converted the date_added column to proper datetime format

Extracted year_added and month_added from date_added

Separated duration into duration_int (number) and duration_type (minutes, seasons)

Removed duplicate entries from the dataset

Exported the final cleaned dataset to a CSV file

Files to be included in the GitHub repository:

Netflix Data Cleaning.ipynb — The Jupyter notebook with all cleaning code
netflix_cleaned.csv — The cleaned dataset
README.txt — This summary file

Submission Steps:

Upload the Jupyter notebook, cleaned dataset, and README file to your GitHub repository

Ensure the files are clearly named and easy to find

Submit the GitHub repo link through the Google Form provided

Tools Used:
